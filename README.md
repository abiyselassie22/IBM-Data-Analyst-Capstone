# IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone

## About

This repository was created to store the completed Jupyter notebooks, IBM Cognos Dashboard & PowerPoint Presentation for the IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project. The project tries to analyze a Survey data and identify insights and trends for the year's report on emerging technologies and skills, and answers what the top programming languages, top databases, popular IDEs, Web frames & Platforms in demand are. The notebook files were completed as as part of the final assignment.

## How the Data is processed for Analysis

As part of a capstone project, I took on the role of a Data Analyst with the Global IT and Business Consulting Services Firm  to assist with collection, web scraping, exploration, wrangling, analysis and visualization of several datasets obtained from various sources to help identify trends for the yearâ€™s report on emerging technologies and skills. 

# Week 1. Data Collection

The data was collected from several datasets (such as Stack Overflow Survey, Github job postings), web scarped and then explored.

# Week 2. Data Wrangling

The data was then wrangled to remove duplicates & impute missing values from the survey dataset, and the cleaned data was normalized.

# Week 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

The wrangled data was subjected to EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to determine the distribution of the normalized data,  and to detect and remove outliers from the survey dataset.

# Week 4. Data Visualization

Various charts  were plotted to visualize the distribution, interesting relationships between features,  composition and comparison of the data. 

# Week 5. Building a Dashboard

IBM Cognos was employed to create interactive dashboards to help analyze & present the data dynamically.

# Week 6. Presentation of Findings

Storytelling skills were used to provide a narrative & present the findings of the analysis.
